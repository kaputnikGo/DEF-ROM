# DEF-ROM
Sound board assembly project

The DEF-ROM project is a place to archive sound code and audio samples.

Examining and experimenting with the 2716 ROM code from Williams Electronics sound boards for games from 1979 to early-mid 1980s

Workspace for the WiLL-i-ROMS Heathkit mod project at https://akm.net.au/will-i-roms/mods.html including mp3 sound player.

Pinball Sound ROMs to examine: 3 (Laser Cue), 4 (Algar), 6 (Pharaoh), 7 (Solar Fire)

TODO comparison between Pinball Sound ROM 1 (Stellar Wars etc) and Sound ROM 6 (Pharaoh) to investigate asm routines and their changes over the lifespan of System 4-7 sound boards. 

Examine the Rat Race ROM (messy) non-production game with 10 machines made

Testing is done on this ET-3400 emulator fork : https://github.com/kaputnikGo/et3400-emu

Disassembler archived here: https://www.oocities.org/pclareuk/DASMx/
